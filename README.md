<b> Wpath is a library totally written by Marco Ortali, written to simplify the path extraction process.</b>

You can get the extension of a file, or just the name with no exception, take all the files with a specific extension in a folder,
and many more things.

This library is under dev. from 2013 when i started it, just to use a lib in every project that manage files, to simplify the process and make
finally a lib without always having to revrite unuseless code.

Anyway, the lib comes with standard javadoc.
